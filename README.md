#Hexagonal-MVP-Reactive

This project show my travel to find an architecture on Android that follow the [SOLID][1] principles and let's my test my code.

##Summary
* [MVP Architecture][2] to separate Android Framework with an [hexagonal architecture][3] to my domain logic.
* Asynchronous communications implemented with [Robospice][4] flavored with [RxJava][5].
* Dependency Injection implemented via [Dagger][6]
* Rest API from [Openlibra][7]

TODO LIST
---------

* Better UI, with Material Design concepts and so on.
* Remove the package ```executor``` and use all RxJava potencial.
* Add More Tests, allways fail on that :(
